# Project-1: Company Website Development

## Description
Every small business has its own storefront, whether it be physical or virtual. For this project, we're expanding a brand into a website. We'll create a fictional business, lightly brand the company, and develop a website based on the needs of the business and its customers.

This project emphasizes navigation, structure, design, and HTML/CSS as the main components.

## Deliverables
- Create a project folder named "project-1" with an HTML file per page.
- Include subfolders for "images" and "css".
- Style the pages using a separate external CSS file.
- Ensure the final website is functional on both Firefox and Chrome.
- Create a repository on GitHub and provide the link in the delivery email.

## Prototype
Your project grade will be based on the final working prototype of your responsive website, built using HTML5/CSS3 in the "code" mode of your chosen text editor.
